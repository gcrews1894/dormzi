### External Sources

For the sake of time, I utilized a responsive carousel package from NPM [https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-responsive-carousel]

I also used a couple of icons from Font Awesome for the forward and back arrows in the PokeDetails page [https://fontawesome.com/]

Everything else was build from scratch with JS and React.
